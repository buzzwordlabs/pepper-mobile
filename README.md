This was our first serious app, and we launched on ProductHunt (https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/3727) with several hundred users. We stopped working on the app in January 2020, and shut it down April 2020. Thanks to a few loyal users that kept using it all that time.

We don't think anyone will make use of this code, but thought it would be better to put the code up than to let it disappear on our computers.

This project is composed of:
1. client/ - a react native app
2. server/ - a typescript node.js server with PostgreSQL (interfacing via TypeORM)
